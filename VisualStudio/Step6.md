In [step 4](./Step4.md) and [Step 5](./Step5.md) you have create a basic query. Both queries returned the same field and the definition for the fields was duplicated for one query to the next. This is of course not very maintainable. Fortunately, GraphQL has a solution for this in the form of fragments.
