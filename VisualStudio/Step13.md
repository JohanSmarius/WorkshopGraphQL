# The end

Congratulations, in the last few hours you have written a working basic GraphQL server. You can be proud of yourself.

Of course, there is a lot more to learn. You can i.e. signal for changes using subscriptions. In demo code there is normally not a lot of focus on the security aspects of the code, but of course, when writing a public facing GraphQL api, this is really necessary. 

I hope the workshop has given you enough confidence to start exploring these and other topics when you get back home. And of course, you can always contact me at @johansmarius (Twitter/X) and johansmarius.bksy.social (Bluesky).

Happy coding!
